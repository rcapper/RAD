### Population Analysis via TypeII-B RAD SNPs
---
Previously, we worked up from raw reads through GATK's UnifiedGenotyper and ended up with a filtered vcf for all six populations.  Now, we will use those SNPs to:
    1) determine distribution of population genetic parameters among and between those populations, 
    2) identify molecular signatures of selection and other evolutionary forces on the genome in hopes of finding genes that may be relevant for local adaptation, 
    3) analyze the history of those populations such as evolutionary rates between pops and across the genome and topology of the pops using a subset of markers and coalescence theory, and 
    4) connectivity among the populations.

Here, we will first 
    1.  calculate the population genetic statistics:
      * Fst: Model-based (BayeScan) AND model-free (vcftools first-pass, vcftools + permutation + bootstrapping)
      * LD
      * Tajima's D
      * pi
      * S
      * rho
    2.  then identify significance (not trivial): BayeScan calculates significance/FDR rates automatically; vcftools should be permuted/bootstrapped to generate a null distribution to which to compare to the values such that a p-value can be calculated.  I'm not sure how to do the latter yet.
    3.  search for patterns or trends: Should we identify Fst outliers alone, or outliers for other stats, or combinations/patterns of different stats, or trends and patterns alone?
    4.  and annotate those 'outlier' regions.  
    
    5.  Then, run STRUCTURE, MIGRATE, BEAST etc.
